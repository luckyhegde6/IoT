/*
    This sketch shows how to use multiple WiFi networks.

    In this example, ESP8266 works in AP mode.
    It demonstrates:
    - Fast connect to previous WiFi network at startup
    - Registering multiple networks (at least 1)
    - Connect to WiFi with strongest signal (RSSI)
    - Fall back to connect to next WiFi when a connection failed or lost
    - Fall back to connect to hidden SSID's which are not reported by WiFi scan

    To enable debugging output, select in the Arduino iDE:
    - Tools | Debug Port: Serial
    - Tools | Debug Level: WiFi
